A C++ game engine coded for optimization and high-quality graphics. 
Made for a specific pirate game that we shall build later down the line however also for other coding projects. 
Built for 3d but also could function in 2d. Physics oriented.
Free to use :) (if we ever get it done)
Since I want anybody to be able to poke around here and make changes while understanding what they are doing, 
the source code includes a setup exe that will give you the tools needed to start,
and some guides about how to use said tools.
