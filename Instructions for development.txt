IF YOU KNOW HOW C++ WORKS OR ALREADY HAVE A DEVELOPING ENVIRONMENT, YOU CAN SKIP THIS

I am attempting to make this code as idiot-proof as possible, so... 
For the benefit of all people who will work on this spaghettified mess of code,(and mostly for the original team) I have provided a starter kit with all the things you need for working on this.
Developing this project will require windows 10/11 for now, I will try to add Mac and Linux options to the setup folder, good luck on your own for now.
I assume you have git, given that you have these files unless you downloaded the zip off the website.
If you pulled off the command line, thank you, you're cool.
If you have no knowledge of how c++, git, VS code, or any of the tools we will be using work, check in the guides folder.
Currently, only the Git guide is written.
Also, if you are a member of the team, please sign your name at the end of every comment and text file you make, it makes the code look cooler
also we can blame people for breaking stuff
Best of luck.
